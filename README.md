A website for writing blogs. Database used is MongoDB along with writing the back-end using Node.js and Express.js

This website is a simple blogging website with a minimalist design.

The blogs as written keep getting populated on the home page:

Since all the pages had to have the same design and structure and only different content, I used EJS templates have been used to create separate webpages for each of the blogs. Moreover, this website uses MongoDB database to store all your blogs so they will still persist and will be kept safely in the database even in case of server failure or network issues.
